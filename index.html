      <h2>Welcome!</h2>

      <p>
      I&rsquo;m a Computer Software Engineering student from
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturias">Asturias</a>,
      Spain.
      <a href="https://ingenieriainformatica.uniovi.es/inicio">
        This is the webpage of my school</a>,
      an institution part of the
      <a href="https://www.uniovi.es/en/">University of Oviedo</a>.
      2020/2021 will be my last year there, since all that remains are one subject and my TFG (Trabajo
      de Fin de Grado / Final Degree Project).

      <h2>My system</h2>

      <p>
      I tend to independence and self-made things, so Linux is my OS of choice. In my free time at the
      computer I tend to tinker with programs and scripts to automate or simplify tasks, or to give
      life to <a href="https://github.com/InigoGutierrez/scripts/tree/master/mapGen">random</a>
      <a href="https://github.com/InigoGutierrez/scripts/tree/master/cardGen">ideas</a>. Here are
      two screenshots from my main computer: one a typical meme r/unixporn setup, the other the more
      common bunch of Vim buffers covering the screen.
      </p>

      <p>
      I used Ubuntu for a short time since it is supposed to be a welcoming distro for noobs. I
      shortly after swapped to Arch, since I felt that Ubuntu had too many components to freely
      tinker, build and learn the system. I&rsquo;ve been using it for almost two years.

      <h2>Other stuff</h2>

      <p>
      I&rsquo;m currently studying the game of Go. I find it a deep and rewarding game which links with
      principles of simplicity and zen.
      </p>

      <p>
      My girlfriend lend me her electric guitar, so I&rsquo;m also trying to learn it (no hurry).
      </p>

      <p>
      Philosophically I&rsquo;m interested in stoicism and zen as inspirations to escape from the nihilism
      and existential dread which permeates our modern society and my generation. Zen also links in
      surprising ways with the Unix Philosophy, so I can more directly apply it to my field of
      knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
      Also, my sister wanted a cat, so I live with this devil called Leiva. She really likes my chair!
